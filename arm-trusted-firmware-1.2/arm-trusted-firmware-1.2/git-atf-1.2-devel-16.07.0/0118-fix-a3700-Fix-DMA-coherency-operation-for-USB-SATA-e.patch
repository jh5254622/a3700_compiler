Subject: [PATCH 118/239] fix: a3700: Fix DMA coherency operation for
 USB/SATA/eMMC

- Add single GPP2 extention to untrusted boot mode for
  switching ON the secure AXIPROT operation state for
  SATA, USB and eMMC masters. This is required for a valid
  DRAM configration acess and DMA coherent operations for
  SATA, USB and eMMC masters.
  The configation is valid for trusted and non-trusted boots.
