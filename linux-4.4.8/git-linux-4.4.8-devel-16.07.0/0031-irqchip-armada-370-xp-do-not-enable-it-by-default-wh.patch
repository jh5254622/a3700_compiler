Subject: [PATCH 031/538] irqchip: armada-370-xp: do not enable it by default
 when ARCH_MVEBU is selected

The irq-armada-370-xp driver can only be built for ARM 32 bits. The mvebu
family had grown with a new ARM64 SoC which will also select the
ARCH_MEVBU configuration. Since "ARM: mvebu: use the ARMADA_370_XP_IRQ
option", the ARM32 mvebu SoC directly select this new option. Selecting
it by default when ARCH_MEVBU is selected is no more needed.

This patch removes this dependency, thanks to this, a kernel for ARM64
mvebu SoC can be built without error due this driver.
