Subject: [PATCH 086/538] clk: unconditionally recurse into clk/mvebu/

The drivers/clk/mvebu directory is only being built when
CONFIG_PLAT_ORION=y. As we are going to support additional mvebu
platforms in drivers/clk/mvebu, which don't have CONFIG_PLAT_ORION=y,
we need to recurse into this directory regardless of the value of
CONFIG_PLAT_ORION.

Since all files in drivers/clk/mvebu/ are already conditionally
compiled depending on various Kconfig options, we can recurse
unconditionally into drivers/clk/mvebu without any other change.
