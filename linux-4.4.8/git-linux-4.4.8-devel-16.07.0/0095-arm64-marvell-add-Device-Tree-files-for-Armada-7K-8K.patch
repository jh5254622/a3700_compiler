Subject: [PATCH 095/538] arm64: marvell: add Device Tree files for Armada
 7K/8K

This commit adds the base Device Tree files for the Armada 7K and 8K
SoCs, as well as the Armada 8040 DB board.

The Armada 7020, 7040 (7K family) and 8020, 8040 (8K family) are
composed of:

 - An AP806 block that contains the CPU core and a few basic
   peripherals. The AP806 is available in dual core configurations
   (used in 7020 and 8020) and quad core configurations (used in 8020
   and 8040).

 - One or two CP110 blocks that contain all the high-speed interfaces
   (SATA, PCIe, Ethernet, etc.). The 7K family chips have one CP110,
   and the 8K family chips have two CP110, giving them twice the
   number of HW interfaces.

In order to represent this from a Device Tree point of view, this
commit creates the following hierarchy:

 * armada-ap806.dtsi - definitions common to dual/quad ap806
   * armada-ap806-dual.dtsi - descrition of the two CPUs
     * armada-7020.dtsi - description of the 7020 SoC
     * armada-8020.dtsi - description of the 8020 SoC
   * armada-ap806-quad.dtsi - description of the four CPUs
     * armada-7040.dtsi - description of the 7040 SoC
     * armada-8040.dtsi - description of the 8040 SoC
       * armada-8040-db.dts - description of the 8040 board

The CP110 blocks are not described yet, and will be part of future
patch series.

+Marvell Armada 7K/8K Platforms Device Tree Bindings
+---------------------------------------------------
+
+Boards using a SoC of the Marvell Armada 7K or 8K families must carry
+the following root node property:
+
+ - compatible, with one of the following values:
+
+   - "marvell,armada7020", "marvell,ap806-dual", "marvell,ap806"
+      when the SoC being used is the Armada 7020
+
+   - "marvell,armada7040", "marvell,ap806-quad", "marvell,ap806"
+      when the SoC being used is the Armada 7040
+
+   - "marvell,armada8020", "marvell,ap806-dual", "marvell,ap806"
+      when the SoC being used is the Armada 8020
+
+   - "marvell,armada8040", "marvell,ap806-quad", "marvell,ap806"
+      when the SoC being used is the Armada 8040
+
+Example:
