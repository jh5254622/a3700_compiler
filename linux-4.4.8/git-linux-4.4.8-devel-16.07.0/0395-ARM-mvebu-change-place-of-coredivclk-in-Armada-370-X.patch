Subject: [PATCH 395/538] ARM: mvebu: change place of coredivclk in Armada
 370/XP DT structure

'coredivclk' in Msys SoC's is not compatible with Armada 370/XP.
Because all those machines will share common armada-370-xp.dtsi
file, above definition have to be placed in a different place of DT
structure.

This commit moves 'coredivclk' to both armada-xp.dtsi and armada-370.dtsi.
It is a preparation for adding Msys SoC kernel support.
