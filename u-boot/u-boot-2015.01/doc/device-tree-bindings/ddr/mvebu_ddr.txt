Marvell DDR bindings
====================

The DDR node includes a description of the DDR controller and PHY configuration.
The driver runs in SPL mode, and is responsible for initializing the DDR PHY and controller
according to user-defined paramters.

DDR PHY mandatory properties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible: "marvell,mvebu-ddr-phy"
	- reg: Base address of the DDR PHY registers.

DDR MAC mandatory properties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible: "marvell,mvebu-ddr-mac"
	- reg: Base address of the DDR MAC registers.
Board specific:
	- cs_count: Number of DDR Chip-Selects on board.
	- bus_width: DDR bus width
	  One out of DDR_BUS_WIDTH_16, DDR_BUS_WIDTH_32, DDR_BUS_WIDTH_64
	- cs#i: Holds porting information for each of the connected chip-selects.
		+ size: Size of DDR connected to Chip-Select (As 64-bit value).

Example:
	ddr-phy {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-ddr-phy";
		reg = <0x20000 0x10>;
		status = "okay";
	};

	ddr-mac {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-ddr-mac";
		reg = <0x20000 0x20>;
		status = "okay";

		cs_count = <1>;
		bus_width = <DDR_BUS_WIDTH_32>;
		cs0 {
			size = <0x00000000 0x20000000>;
		};
	};
